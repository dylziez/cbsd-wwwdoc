<p>In view of some of the subtleties with FreeBSD vnet-jail, information about it deduced this separate article</p>
First of all, the <b>VIMAGE</b> functionality requires a customized kernel with
<pre>
  options VIMAGE
</pre>
If you get a kernel from the repository through a command cbsd:
<pre>
  cbsd repo action=get sources=kernel
</pre>
that your kernel is supports for VIMAGE.
<br><br>
In the case when kernel has no options, parameter <b>vnet</b> in the file <i>${workdir}/nc.inventory</i> will always be set to <b>0</b>
<br><br>
If this option is present in the kernel, in the configurator of creation jail will be present parameter <b>vnet</b>.
<br><br>
Second, keep in mind that although <b>VIMAGE</b> (available from FreeBSD 8.0) and held the status of an experimental feature for the 4 years of its existence in the base operating system,
it can still be found a variety of problems, the correction of which is extremely tightened: in GNATS (current ticket system FreeBSD) 
quite <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr-summary.cgi?category=&severity=&priority=&class=&state=&sort=none&text=vimage&responsible=&multitext=&originator=&release=">a few</a>
panics messages using VIMAGE in conjunction with the various components;
<br><br>Besides <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=164763">seen</a> cases of memory leaking.
<br><br>
Well, now the good;)
<br>
<p><b>vnet</b>-featured jail has at its disposal a fully virtualized and isolated network stack, which in turn allows the use of a private jail (albeit virtual)
interface, "right" <b>loopback</b>, use within the jail a packet filters (<b>pf, ipfw, pfilter</b>), raise the tunnels and reconfigure the routing table.
</p>
When you create a vnet-jails the <b>ip4_addr</b> should indicate <b>0</b>, which prohibit cbsd set itself an IP address for vnet jail.
<br>
<i>Note: The installation of IP addresses in the vnet jail is not implemented yet</i>
<br>
Also, if you want to get a jail itself an IP address automatically (via DHCP), you would write a separate section devfs.rules, in which you need to open 
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=bpf&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.2-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html"><b>bpf(4)</b></a>-device ( unhide bpf*), and set 
this devfs rule number to <b>vnet</b>-jail (via <b>cbsd jconfig jname=XXXX</b>)
<br>
cbsd creates virtual interfaces using a pair of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=epair&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+9.2-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html"><b>epair(4)</b></a>, but the "other end" virtual cable that connects to the jail, <b>cbsd</b> renamed to <b>eth0</b> interface.
<br><br>
<i>Note: </i>: Rename this is relevant only for FreeBSD jails. If a jail is run as Linux-based, renaming will not happen.
<br><br>
Renaming to <b>eth0</b> by the fact that each new <b>epair</b> increments the number of the interface, those of the first <b>vnet</b>-jail in original, interface will be called as epair<b>0</b>a. When you running the fifth of jails, in last jail
interface will be called as epair<b>5</b>a. It's not very convenient whith jail migrating (on another server, it may be a different number), and definitely not convenient that every time you have to correct the contents of the rc.conf
with the network setup.
